# rubygems-integration

This package makes Debian Ruby recognizable by Rubygems. The packages will be
listed by `gem list` and will be recognized by Rubygems. They can be used to
satisfy dependencies both with plain Rubygems and with Bundler. As a special
case, they can be used to satisfy dependencies of Rails 3 applications.

# How to make a Debian Ruby package work with rubygems-integration

Install a gemspec file to /usr/share/rubygems-integration/$VERSION to make the
package available for Ruby $VERSION (e.g. if $VERSION is 1.9.1 the the package
will be visible to Rubygems on Ruby 1.9)
